https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['drama'],the shawshank redemption is written and directed by frank darabont it is an adaptation of the stephen king novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption starring tim robbins and morgan freeman the film portrays the story of andy dufresne robbins a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at shawshank state prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate ellis red redding freeman while things start to pick up when the warden finds andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker however the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of themthere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94 with a title that didnt give much inkling to anyone about what it was about and with columbia pictures unsure how to market it shawshank redemption barely registered at the box office however come academy award time the film received several nominations and although it won none it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release the rest as they say is history for the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic something that has delighted its fans whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors one thing is for sure though is that which ever side of the shawshank fence you sit on the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical statusits possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms the implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion yet when characters are this richly drawn and so movingly performed it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama thats dealing in hope friendship and faith the sentimental aspect is indeed there but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist cosy prison life you say no chance the need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration surely and given the quite terrific performances of robbins never better  freeman sublimely making it easy its the easiest thing in the world to warm to andy and redthose in support arent faring too bad either bob gunton is coiled spring smarm as warden norton james whitmore is heart achingly great as the birdman of shawshank clancy brown is menacing as antagonist capt byron hadley william sadler amusing as heywood  mark rolston is impressively vile as bogs diamond then theres roger deakins lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters yes they are ours the music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too thomas newmans score is mostly piano based dovetailing neatly with andys state of mind while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of hank williams to the gorgeous le nozze di figaro by mozartif you love shawshank then its a love that lasts a lifetime every viewing brings the same array of emotions  anger  revilement  happiness  sadness  inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment above all else though shawshank offers hope  not just for characters in a movie  but for a better life and a better world for all of us 1010
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068646/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['crime'],the godfather is the pinnacle of flawless films the first time i viewed the godfather i was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film i had ever seen and has since then stood as my alltime favourite film it is due to this that i have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic so lets start from the beginning the film opens to four words i believe in america its crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the films threshold this is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film and believe me there are a lot after the first take we are then absorbed into the life of vito corleone brilliantly portrayed by the oscar winning performance of marlon brando vito is a feared man he is a criminal he is a mafioso but above all he is a respected family man his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors james caan john cazale and al pacino as well as his adopted child tom hagen played by robert duvall the film follows vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son michael with some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970s film industry including a certain horses head the godfather epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film the corleones are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen whilst they are villains the audience will refuse to accept that fact coppola does something simple and audacious he takes the guilt out of organised crime a film rife with beautiful cinematography memorable musical scores and wellpaced action and drama overall the godfather is one of hollywoods greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right a gangster flick that is overflowing with life rich with emotion and subtle acting and further blessed with amazing direction from francis ford coppola arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071562/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['crime'],coppolas masterpiece is rivaled only by the godfather part ii in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of powerthe film breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods the early career of young vito corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in sicily and then in 1917 building his criminal underworld in the italian ghettos of new york city post world war i plus that of his son michael al pacino desperately trying to keep his family togetheral pacinos performance is quiet and solemn he is cold and ruthless with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film here hes a calculating and frightening force seeking to expand casinos into prerevolutionary cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging senators or trying to outface his worst enemiesthe films haunting final shot of a lonely isolated paranoid michael in his empty compound is an unforgettable movie scene a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person emotionally empty and finished far from a waspish wife more distant from a faithful lawyerde niros rise from an orphan child by a family feud back in italy to a hood in new york and his position as a respected don provides a welcome break from pacinos relentless attitude since the people he kills seem to deserve it vito comes off better than michael does and it was wise of coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuitythe entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film lee strasberg a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness g d spradlin absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt nevada senator michael v gazzo unforgettable as the troubled grayhaired informer gastone moschin excellent as the blackmailer in white suit john cazale marvelously timid as the vague confused and hesitant fredo diane keaton clearly irrational as the longsuffering wife kay talia shire too extravagant as the lousy mother troy donahue too ambitious as the fortunehunting suitor and robert duvall excels as the confidant and retainer to the allpowerful corleone familycoppolas motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original its a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor it is not really a sequel its just more it cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['crime'],an excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist instead of following the trial itself the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room the film begins with the end of the trial the jurors retire to deliberate the case a preliminary vote is taken and the result is 111 in favour of the guilty verdict eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father only juror 8 has doubts at first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes rightfully that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror 8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit as time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all but not everyone is easy to convincealthough the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors the character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting excellent dialogue and nearflawless actingjuror 1  a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out he appears at ease only once during the film  when he talks about football he has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury  a task he clearly does not relishjuror 2  a small quite man clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance apparently he finds solace in his job  he is an accountantjuror 3  probably the most complex personality in the film starts off like a pleasant selfmade successful businessman he analyses the case impartially explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured as time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case  he also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability wonderfully played by lee j cobb  this is the character you remember after the film is overjuror 4  self assured slightly arrogant stockbroker obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but as one of the jurors says  this is not an exact science he does not take into account the feelings the passions the characters of the people involved in the case he is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off it is a very hot dayjuror 5  here is a man under great emotional stress he comes from the same social background as the accused boy  with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty  he does not want compassion to influence him  so ironically it doesjuror 6  a simple man quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations but he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistakejuror 7  the only one that really has no opinion on this case literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case  he talks of baseball of the heat of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever  he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think its worth the botherjuror 8 a caring man has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors he tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible oddsjuror 9  a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the casejuror 10  the most horrifying character in the film votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boys social background the tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boys  which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the differencejuror 11  an immigrant watchmaker careful methodical man well mannered and soft spoken respects the right of people to have different opinion to his  and is willing to look at both sides of the problem loses his temper only once  horrified by the complete indifference of juror 7juror 12  a young business type  perhaps he has his own opinions  but is careful to hide them what he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people thinkthe film succeeds in doing something very rare today  developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable memorable and distinct characters
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108052/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['biography'],i have only ever seen this film once i only ever want to see this film once and i will only ever need to see this film once it is etched on my mind i like many others left in silence  i could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film picking small points of detail or of style or even scoring points off the director it stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema a magnificent accomplishment
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167260/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['action'],ive just rewatched the lord of the rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight nearly 15 years since the fellowship of the rings was released i still havent seen a movie thats better nor close to any of these three films the casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie i can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored they are a light to this world and wouldnt be the same without themi miss the good old lotrs days the best movies ever created the return of the king was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['crime'],one of the early scenes in pulp fiction features two hitmen discussing what a big mac is called in other countries their dialogue is witty and entertaining and its also disarming because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal if you didnt know better you might assume these were regular guys having chitchat on their way to work other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims their talk has no relevance to anything in the film or to anything else for that matter yet without such scenes pulp fiction wouldnt be pulp fiction i get the sense that tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully texturedits no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended the film is so intricately structured with so many astonishing details many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation but there is no deeper explanation pulp fiction is as the title indicates purely an exercise in technique and style albeit a brilliant and layered one containing numerous references to other films it is like a great work of abstract art or art about art it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies fine writing firstrate acting unforgettable characters and one of the most wellconstructed narratives ive ever seen in a film but to what end the selfcontained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itselfthe movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that its essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie but something always goes wrong some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures tarantinos originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead even if they move the story away from conventional plot developmentsperhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions indeed the whole film seems to consist of digressions no character ever says anything in a simple straightforward manner jules could have simply told yolanda be cool and no ones going to get hurt which is just the type of line youd find in a generic runofthemill action flick instead he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like tarantino savors every word of his characters finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references but the lines arent just witty they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior think of mias statement to vincent thats when you know youve found somebody special when you can just shut the f up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silencewhat is the movies purpose exactly im not sure but it does deal a lot with the theme of power marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time the whole point of the big date sequence which happens to be my favorite section of the film is the power that marsellus has over his men without even being present this power is what gets vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away the power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film its liberal use of the nword in this film the word isnt just used as an epithet to describe blacks jules for instance at one point applies the term to vincent it has more to do with power than with race the powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters most of these gangsters are not racist in practice indeed they are intermingled racially and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many lawabiding citizens in our society they resort to racial epithets because its a patter that establishes their separateness from the noncriminal worldtheres a nice moral progression to the stories we presume that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty later butchs act of heroism could be motivated by honor but were never sure the film ends however with jules making a clear moral choice thus the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for selfpreservationstill its hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories none of the stories are really about anything they certainly are not about hitmen pontificating about burgers nor is the film really a satire or a farce although it contains elements of both at times it feels like a tale that didnt need to be told but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind or of any other kind

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['drama'],fight club is one of those movies that hits the spot without missing an inch of it the nameless narrator edward norton is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life from the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraiting how consumerism moves the world but is unable to give relief in the end flipping through catalogues of new furnite for his apartment were the narrators only personality trait to fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups by lying to people pretending he has conditions he does not have the narrator finds relief  the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night the emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic david fincher makes a subtle yet clear comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other the system doesnt care about anyone the distance between people  especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world  is a major plot point however when the narrator is finds someone whos a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape   her lie reflected my lie suddenly i felt nothing i couldnt cry so once again i couldnt sleepshortly after tyler durden brad pitt is introduced into the story the main character loses everything he valued deprived of his possessions he seeks solace in the company of a man who is the polar opposite of what he is if the narrator is a worker whos way too worried about his condo and his job tyler is a freewheeling soapmaker who couldnt care less about all those things the contrast between them is clear tyler refuses any consumerist logic from the narrator whilst making he see how futile is the lifestyle he was leading  right we are consumers were the byproducts of a lifestyle obsession the characters here portraid are so different because one of them is free while the other is not tyler in a nihilistic way helps the narrator realize that his existence is meaningless enough  something that is clearly displayed in the capitalist world  that all they can do is giving up everything the selfdestruction promoted by the fight club is ironically what allows the narrator  as well as many other frustrated men  to find solace in their mundane life little by little the narrator is stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job about behavior and the value of things its interesting to note that the narrator doesnt quit his job immediately picturing how hard it is actually to cut ties with the system  he eventually does thoughmany subtopics are discussed through the movie we see the narrator and tyler now living together talking about many things they talk about how both had an absent father how both lacked a sense of direction in life at some point and were told to follow the common sense  he says get a job so im 25 i call again and say now what he says i dunno get married the nature of the system we live in tells us what to do since the moment were born while both of them agree on that they also agree that this is all a great waste of time its important to notice though that both them had no significant connections with other people especially with women as tyler comments  were a generation of men raised by women im wondering if another woman is really the answer we needas the club grows the movie delves even deeper in those reflections about what really matters in life  advertising has us chasing cars and clothes working jobs we hate so we can buy st we dont need tyler becomes the source of inspiration for everyone who attends to the fight club everyone is much more like the narrator but theyre striving to be more like him at some point tyler decides that the club is meant to be something bigger  what he would call project mayhem while the original fight club was something kept like a secret idealized to give some sort of freedom through selfdestruction to its members project mayhem is about declaring a fight against the system the frustrated collective consciousness was the straw that broke the camels back  weve all been raised on television to believe that one day wed all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars but we wont and were slowly learning that fact and were very very pied off however the narrator starts to slowly go against what tyler was meaning to do  kinda of recalling a bit of his past self and a sort of respect for the authority of society  and when this happen its the moment the movie reaches its climaxthe genius of the movie is displayed when we discover that tyler durden and the narrator are the same person they have always been the same person due to his declining mental health and his rather meaningless life he created an alterego  someone capable of manifesting everything he wasnt as a system abiding person the contrast created by tylers different personalities is amazing to watch as the truth unfolds and the ambivalence created when we discover the truth about tyler durden is even more marvelous this movie portraits very well how a person can reach the extremes of their mind in a system that overlooks the relevance of your very existence  when you become just a number just a braindead member of society having your hopes and wishes constantly ignored in the end tyler recovers his sanity only to see that his actions cant be reverted  so he only stands by and watches the final scene is beautiful what could be bettar than watching the system crumbling before your eyes while where is my mind plays this movie is a masterpiece and it is so entrancing because of how real it is  in the end the movie shows many things we know and think but tend to keep hidden it is provocative funny and thrilling and most importantly it is so damn real the plot aged perfectly and i dont think it is going to get old so soon  this movie is a must watch
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['drama'],when i first saw this movie i didnt appreciate it like i do now i think it may have been because i was so young when i first saw it just recently i saw the movie again what an amazing story and moving meaning that movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it that life isnt as bad as most people make it seem that an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence the meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life that we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back that truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we dont like it that we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like theres no hope i just love this movie and anyone who hasnt seen it or who thinks that dont like it i seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again it truly is amazing
https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['action'],"my 3rd time watching this movie yet it still stunned my mind kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward
for someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how christopher nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen as its been done so sophisticatedly i do believe the rumour that nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of inception in my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career i jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of nolans remarkable works
memento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film ive ever seen but overall it doesnt reach the same level of inceptionthe prestige is highly impressive but somehow i havent been able to find the very particular nolans spirit in itthe batman trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak the dark knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well nonetheless every time we talk about it heath ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole the uniqueandonly jokerthen there came inception where nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way the multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting from visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them i believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing in addition nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messageslater we had interstellar though i did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of inception
spoilers ahead  for all who havent watched this movie you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersit is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream there is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world our hero mr cobb leonardo dicaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner arthur joseph gordonlevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  mr saito ken watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of steeling he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception in return saito offers something that cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him so cobb and arthur gather a team to carry out the mission eames tom hardy  a veteran identity forger yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and ariadne ellen page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission the target is robert fischer cillian murphy  son and heir of saitos biggest competitor maurice fischer whos dying the goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception while the team go deeper and deeper into fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero why he has became such an expert of inception and what is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionthe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life in cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife mal marion cotillard and his regrets so as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense yes were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history did cobb find mr saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream but all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission when we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters and after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live so from this point of view he has solved the maze of his life
some short lines about the cast

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['comedy'],its not really a review but my attempt to explain how i interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated especially if the reason is that they didnt like the second half of itits much easier to understand the message of a movie when the good guys win or the bad guys get punished in the end im not saying that all hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values but still i believe that parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which theres a character with a clearer moral center whom audiences can easily relate to so i think its no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiencessome complained that they dont understand kitaeks motive for killing mr park but to fully appreciate this you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is crossing the lineits a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other peoples privacy or as one should mind ones own social position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position if interpreted as the latter meaning it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families respective dwellingsit would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner but the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if bong joonho chose such a path and he is too good a director not to see such a dangerinstead he chose to make mr park a reasonable enough character despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature he seems to treat kitaek fairly enough at first but he also warns the latter not to cross the line if kitaek attempts to pry into his private lifeat first it seems that its quite easy for kitaek and other members of his family to sneak into mr parks house in various roles and mingle with them kitaek even compliments how nice mr parks family is but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard when he was hiding under the table what mr park really thinks of him  almost a different species of the human being who doesnt even smell like himkitaeks final disillusionment came when mr park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his sons shock while virtually ignoring kitaeks daughters status whos dying on the ground spurting blood from the stab woundthat moment kitaek realizes how mr park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being but something much more insignificantand he also realizes the line that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour instead it is a line that can even determine the life of those lesser human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those proper human beingshowever easy it was for kitaeks family to sneak into mr parks house or however they try to socialize and mingle with mr parks family their existence is no better than that of a parasite which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the housewith such disillusionment and anger kitaek chose to kill mr park as a parasite could to its host and like a parasite he keeps hiding deep inside the dead hosts body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offspringsthe tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either mr parks or kitaeks personalities instead its a line drawn by an invisible hand separating those classes according to their respective social conditions which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners and that is what i believe to be the message this film is trying to conveyof course not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a carefree pastime that everyone can understandbut without if the movie didnt change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056058/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['action'],i saw harakiri seppuku in a new 35 mm print at nycs film forum this is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture writers shinobu hashimoto and yasuhiko takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by the count of monte cristo ambrose bierce and howard hawks westerns as much as by samurai literature and moviesthe film begins deceptively as a story within a story seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor such as in the conventional oftretold tale of the 47 ronin the context is set at a time when the central government the shogunate is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people notably their samurai forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse but the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from hiroshimavery gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tensionit is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity where a priority is put on family support education and creative productivity in comparison to the macho opening relationships with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier ritualized scenes in sharp relief particularly the recurring image of the clans armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbolthe psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure and those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century american can glean like downfall der untergang it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to world war iithe repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters the revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional japanese art including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfallthe over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0253474/reviews?ref_=tt_urv,['biography'],i can remember when this film came out i was adamantly against seeing it i had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic jewish holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the germans to add some flavourhow wrong i wasthis is one of the best films i have ever seen and what it did to me i cannot describe in words but in a nutshell it moved me made me cry made me feel like i was in the polish ghetto in 1940 and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as i walked out of the theater and thanked god that i live in the free society that i do roman polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like chinatown and rosemarys baby but this is his crowning achievement i think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film i believe that the oscars are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year it tells you that it should have won best picture but the weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone hence a charlatan like chicago takes top prize sorry for the digression here but when you compare a film like chicago to a masterpiece like the pianist there really is one clear cut winner they handed out the statue to the wrong moviethe pianist follows up and coming piano player wlad spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos surviving only by the kindness of strangers i think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because spielzman is a man that we can all relate to he is not a hero he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge he is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive he is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide and this is how i related to him if put in his position how would i react exactly the way he did this is a man that had everything taken from him his livelihood his family his freedom and almost his life there is no time for heroics here adrien brody embodies the spirit of spielzman and his win at this years oscars was one of the happiest moments i have had watching the festivities his speech was even better but that is a topic for another timeultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the german soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes ive witnessed with very little dialogue it is in the eyes the face the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know i think it is this scene that won brody his oscar this is one of the all time great performancesi think polanski spoke from the heart here he has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other i think the pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done chicago will be forgotten the way ordinary people was forgotten and when people talk about the film the pianist they will do so with reverence and respect this is a cinematic masterpiece10 out of 10
