      "the shawshank redemption is written and directed by frank darabont it is an adaptation of the stephen king novella rita hayworth and shawshank redemption starring tim robbins and morgan freeman the film portrays the story of andy dufresne robbins a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at shawshank state prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate ellis red redding freeman while things start to pick up when the warden finds andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker however the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of themthere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94 with a title that didnt give much inkling to anyone about what it was about and with columbia pictures unsure how to market it shawshank redemption barely registered at the box office however come academy award time the film received several nominations and although it won none it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release the rest as they say is history for the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic something that has delighted its fans whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors one thing is for sure though is that which ever side of the shawshank fence you sit on the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical statusits possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms the implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion yet when characters are this richly drawn and so movingly performed it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama thats dealing in hope friendship and faith the sentimental aspect is indeed there but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist cosy prison life you say no chance the need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration surely and given the quite terrific performances of robbins never better  freeman sublimely making it easy its the easiest thing in the world to warm to andy and redthose in support arent faring too bad either bob gunton is coiled spring smarm as warden norton james whitmore is heart achingly great as the birdman of shawshank clancy brown is menacing as antagonist capt byron hadley william sadler amusing as heywood  mark rolston is impressively vile as bogs diamond then theres roger deakins lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters yes they are ours the music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too thomas newmans score is mostly piano based dovetailing neatly with andys state of mind while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of hank williams to the gorgeous le nozze di figaro by mozartif you love shawshank then its a love that lasts a lifetime every viewing brings the same array of emotions  anger  revilement  happiness  sadness  inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment above all else though shawshank offers hope  not just for characters in a movie  but for a better life and a better world for all of us 1010\n",

      "the godfather is the pinnacle of flawless films the first time i viewed the godfather i was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film i had ever seen and has since then stood as my alltime favourite film it is due to this that i have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic so lets start from the beginning the film opens to four words i believe in america its crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the films threshold this is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film and believe me there are a lot after the first take we are then absorbed into the life of vito corleone brilliantly portrayed by the oscar winning performance of marlon brando vito is a feared man he is a criminal he is a mafioso but above all he is a respected family man his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors james caan john cazale and al pacino as well as his adopted child tom hagen played by robert duvall the film follows vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son michael with some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970s film industry including a certain horses head the godfather epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film the corleones are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen whilst they are villains the audience will refuse to accept that fact coppola does something simple and audacious he takes the guilt out of organised crime a film rife with beautiful cinematography memorable musical scores and wellpaced action and drama overall the godfather is one of hollywoods greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right a gangster flick that is overflowing with life rich with emotion and subtle acting and further blessed with amazing direction from francis ford coppola arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made\n",

      "coppolas masterpiece is rivaled only by the godfather part ii in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of powerthe film breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods the early career of young vito corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in sicily and then in 1917 building his criminal underworld in the italian ghettos of new york city post world war i plus that of his son michael al pacino desperately trying to keep his family togetheral pacinos performance is quiet and solemn he is cold and ruthless with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film here hes a calculating and frightening force seeking to expand casinos into prerevolutionary cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging senators or trying to outface his worst enemiesthe films haunting final shot of a lonely isolated paranoid michael in his empty compound is an unforgettable movie scene a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person emotionally empty and finished far from a waspish wife more distant from a faithful lawyerde niros rise from an orphan child by a family feud back in italy to a hood in new york and his position as a respected don provides a welcome break from pacinos relentless attitude since the people he kills seem to deserve it vito comes off better than michael does and it was wise of coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuitythe entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film lee strasberg a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness g d spradlin absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt nevada senator michael v gazzo unforgettable as the troubled grayhaired informer gastone moschin excellent as the blackmailer in white suit john cazale marvelously timid as the vague confused and hesitant fredo diane keaton clearly irrational as the longsuffering wife kay talia shire too extravagant as the lousy mother troy donahue too ambitious as the fortunehunting suitor and robert duvall excels as the confidant and retainer to the allpowerful corleone familycoppolas motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original its a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor it is not really a sequel its just more it cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters\n"

      "an excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist instead of following the trial itself the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room the film begins with the end of the trial the jurors retire to deliberate the case a preliminary vote is taken and the result is 111 in favour of the guilty verdict eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father only juror 8 has doubts at first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes rightfully that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror 8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit as time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all but not everyone is easy to convincealthough the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors the character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting excellent dialogue and nearflawless actingjuror 1  a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out he appears at ease only once during the film  when he talks about football he has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury  a task he clearly does not relishjuror 2  a small quite man clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance apparently he finds solace in his job  he is an accountantjuror 3  probably the most complex personality in the film starts off like a pleasant selfmade successful businessman he analyses the case impartially explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured as time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case  he also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability wonderfully played by lee j cobb  this is the character you remember after the film is overjuror 4  self assured slightly arrogant stockbroker obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but as one of the jurors says  this is not an exact science he does not take into account the feelings the passions the characters of the people involved in the case he is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off it is a very hot dayjuror 5  here is a man under great emotional stress he comes from the same social background as the accused boy  with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty  he does not want compassion to influence him  so ironically it doesjuror 6  a simple man quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations but he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistakejuror 7  the only one that really has no opinion on this case literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case  he talks of baseball of the heat of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever  he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think its worth the botherjuror 8 a caring man has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors he tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible oddsjuror 9  a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the casejuror 10  the most horrifying character in the film votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boys social background the tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boys  which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the differencejuror 11  an immigrant watchmaker careful methodical man well mannered and soft spoken respects the right of people to have different opinion to his  and is willing to look at both sides of the problem loses his temper only once  horrified by the complete indifference of juror 7juror 12  a young business type  perhaps he has his own opinions  but is careful to hide them what he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people thinkthe film succeeds in doing something very rare today  developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable memorable and distinct characters\n",

      "one of the early scenes in pulp fiction features two hitmen discussing what a big mac is called in other countries their dialogue is witty and entertaining and its also disarming because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal if you didnt know better you might assume these were regular guys having chitchat on their way to work other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims their talk has no relevance to anything in the film or to anything else for that matter yet without such scenes pulp fiction wouldnt be pulp fiction i get the sense that tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully texturedits no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended the film is so intricately structured with so many astonishing details many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation but there is no deeper explanation pulp fiction is as the title indicates purely an exercise in technique and style albeit a brilliant and layered one containing numerous references to other films it is like a great work of abstract art or art about art it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies fine writing firstrate acting unforgettable characters and one of the most wellconstructed narratives ive ever seen in a film but to what end the selfcontained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itselfthe movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that its essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie but something always goes wrong some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures tarantinos originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead even if they move the story away from conventional plot developmentsperhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions indeed the whole film seems to consist of digressions no character ever says anything in a simple straightforward manner jules could have simply told yolanda be cool and no ones going to get hurt which is just the type of line youd find in a generic runofthemill action flick instead he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like tarantino savors every word of his characters finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references but the lines arent just witty they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior think of mias statement to vincent thats when you know youve found somebody special when you can just shut the f up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silencewhat is the movies purpose exactly im not sure but it does deal a lot with the theme of power marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time the whole point of the big date sequence which happens to be my favorite section of the film is the power that marsellus has over his men without even being present this power is what gets vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away the power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film its liberal use of the nword in this film the word isnt just used as an epithet to describe blacks jules for instance at one point applies the term to vincent it has more to do with power than with race the powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters most of these gangsters are not racist in practice indeed they are intermingled racially and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many lawabiding citizens in our society they resort to racial epithets because its a patter that establishes their separateness from the noncriminal worldtheres a nice moral progression to the stories we presume that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty later butchs act of heroism could be motivated by honor but were never sure the film ends however with jules making a clear moral choice thus the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for selfpreservationstill its hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories none of the stories are really about anything they certainly are not about hitmen pontificating about burgers nor is the film really a satire or a farce although it contains elements of both at times it feels like a tale that didnt need to be told but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind or of any other kind\n"

      "a sprawling western epic that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for 200000 in stolen gold sergio leones the good the bad and the ugly is a masterpiece one that continues to get better and better with each viewing  in a way its a morality play weighing the consequences of good and evil but it does so in a realistic manner  sometimes crime does pay at least in the short term and sometimes good does go unrewarded this film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional john wayne white hatblack hat westernthe three main characters make the film  lee van cleef the bad is evil personified  totally ruthless hell do whatever it takes to get what he wants  clint eastwood the good is the man with no name not really good in a traditional sense    but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing  watch the scene when he gives a dying confederate soldier a puff of his cigar  powerful and it sums up everything that the man with no name is all about without saying a single word  eli wallach the ugly is tuco and hes easily the most complex  if not the best  character in the film  all impulse and rage tuco spins wildly throughout the movie stealing lying pretending to be clint eastwoods best friend in one scene trying to kill him in another  tuco truly represents the ugly side of peoplethe movie is long but theres not a wasted scene in the film  each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace revealing more about each character and whats going on  the pacing is incredible as is the direction  sergio leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film keeping the film from ever getting predictable  any typical western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by leones masterful storytelling  of special mention is ennio morricones score which is absolutely perfect  two scenes  one in a union prison camp one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film  are amazing on their own but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with morricones powerful score this movie is absolutely brilliant  if you havent seen it yet i strongly urge to do so  immediately  and then go watch unforgiven    in a way i think that unforgiven is the sequel to the good the bad and the ugly  its the story of what eventually happened to the man with no name the good the bad and the ugly is easily one of the best westerns ever made  a\n",

      "fight club is one of those movies that hits the spot without missing an inch of it the nameless narrator edward norton is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life from the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraiting how consumerism moves the world but is unable to give relief in the end flipping through catalogues of new furnite for his apartment were the narrators only personality trait to fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups by lying to people pretending he has conditions he does not have the narrator finds relief  the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night the emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic david fincher makes a subtle yet clear comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other the system doesnt care about anyone the distance between people  especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world  is a major plot point however when the narrator is finds someone whos a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape   her lie reflected my lie suddenly i felt nothing i couldnt cry so once again i couldnt sleepshortly after tyler durden brad pitt is introduced into the story the main character loses everything he valued deprived of his possessions he seeks solace in the company of a man who is the polar opposite of what he is if the narrator is a worker whos way too worried about his condo and his job tyler is a freewheeling soapmaker who couldnt care less about all those things the contrast between them is clear tyler refuses any consumerist logic from the narrator whilst making he see how futile is the lifestyle he was leading  right we are consumers were the byproducts of a lifestyle obsession the characters here portraid are so different because one of them is free while the other is not tyler in a nihilistic way helps the narrator realize that his existence is meaningless enough  something that is clearly displayed in the capitalist world  that all they can do is giving up everything the selfdestruction promoted by the fight club is ironically what allows the narrator  as well as many other frustrated men  to find solace in their mundane life little by little the narrator is stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job about behavior and the value of things its interesting to note that the narrator doesnt quit his job immediately picturing how hard it is actually to cut ties with the system  he eventually does thoughmany subtopics are discussed through the movie we see the narrator and tyler now living together talking about many things they talk about how both had an absent father how both lacked a sense of direction in life at some point and were told to follow the common sense  he says get a job so im 25 i call again and say now what he says i dunno get married the nature of the system we live in tells us what to do since the moment were born while both of them agree on that they also agree that this is all a great waste of time its important to notice though that both them had no significant connections with other people especially with women as tyler comments  were a generation of men raised by women im wondering if another woman is really the answer we needas the club grows the movie delves even deeper in those reflections about what really matters in life  advertising has us chasing cars and clothes working jobs we hate so we can buy st we dont need tyler becomes the source of inspiration for everyone who attends to the fight club everyone is much more like the narrator but theyre striving to be more like him at some point tyler decides that the club is meant to be something bigger  what he would call project mayhem while the original fight club was something kept like a secret idealized to give some sort of freedom through selfdestruction to its members project mayhem is about declaring a fight against the system the frustrated collective consciousness was the straw that broke the camels back  weve all been raised on television to believe that one day wed all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars but we wont and were slowly learning that fact and were very very pied off however the narrator starts to slowly go against what tyler was meaning to do  kinda of recalling a bit of his past self and a sort of respect for the authority of society  and when this happen its the moment the movie reaches its climaxthe genius of the movie is displayed when we discover that tyler durden and the narrator are the same person they have always been the same person due to his declining mental health and his rather meaningless life he created an alterego  someone capable of manifesting everything he wasnt as a system abiding person the contrast created by tylers different personalities is amazing to watch as the truth unfolds and the ambivalence created when we discover the truth about tyler durden is even more marvelous this movie portraits very well how a person can reach the extremes of their mind in a system that overlooks the relevance of your very existence  when you become just a number just a braindead member of society having your hopes and wishes constantly ignored in the end tyler recovers his sanity only to see that his actions cant be reverted  so he only stands by and watches the final scene is beautiful what could be bettar than watching the system crumbling before your eyes while where is my mind plays this movie is a masterpiece and it is so entrancing because of how real it is  in the end the movie shows many things we know and think but tend to keep hidden it is provocative funny and thrilling and most importantly it is so damn real the plot aged perfectly and i dont think it is going to get old so soon  this movie is a must watch\n"

      "when i first saw this movie i didnt appreciate it like i do now i think it may have been because i was so young when i first saw it just recently i saw the movie again what an amazing story and moving meaning that movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it that life isnt as bad as most people make it seem that an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence the meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life that we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back that truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we dont like it that we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like theres no hope i just love this movie and anyone who hasnt seen it or who thinks that dont like it i seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again it truly is amazing\n",

      "for someone like me whove rarely slept without dream its so exciting watching how christopher nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen as its been done so sophisticatedly i do believe the rumour that nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of inception in my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career i jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of nolans remarkable works\n",
      "memento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film ive ever seen but overall it doesnt reach the same level of inceptionthe prestige is highly impressive but somehow i havent been able to find the very particular nolans spirit in itthe batman trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak the dark knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well nonetheless every time we talk about it heath ledger takes all the spotlights with his lifetimerole the uniqueandonly jokerthen there came inception where nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way the multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting from visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them i believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing in addition nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messageslater we had interstellar though i did admire its cinematography and visualeffects the film itself is nowhere near the level of inception\n",

      "i went into this film with the knowledge that it had been the second film in history to win the top five oscars for best picture best actor best actress best director and best screenplay and has been praised as one of jack nicholsons finest roles and one of the classics of the 70s naturally after hearing all this i had high expectations for one flew over the cuckoos nest but nonetheless i was surprised at how easily the film surpassed my expectations and easily led me to understand how it merited all that praisebased on the novel by ken kesey the story follows randle patrick mcmurphy jack nicholson who in an attempt to get out of spending more time in prison pleads insanity for his crime and is therefore sentenced to time in a mental institution this was mcmurphys intention as he believes the conditions in a crazy house will be significantly easier to contend with than another harsh stay in prison however he quickly finds out that surviving the institution with its desolate patients including christopher lloyd danny devito vincent schiavelli and an absolutely brilliant brad dourif as the stuttering billy bibbit and the monstrously repressive nurse ratchet louise fletcher in a career defining role is considerably harder than he imagined mcmurphy plays pranks horseplay and is generally defiant to the rules of the institution in an attempt to raise spirits his constant optimism and reckless defiance to the out of date rules in the institution can be very uplifting and often quite funny as well but much of the movie can be very depressing  the generally decrepit state of the institution is a consistently and intentionally bleak background to a superb story with a truly bittersweet endingjack nicholson is at his best here head and shoulders above other excellent performances such as in chinatown or as good as it gets mcmurphy is an apparently unquenchable optimist refusing to succumb to the defeated spirit of all the other patients his livewire antics inspiring the patients are generally uplifting and when his indomitable spirit is finally broken we really feel for him and his fellow patients nicholson conveys the essence of mcmurphy to perfection demonstrating his excellent understanding and interpretation of the character when mcmurphy announces that he is going to lift a huge stone fountain and hurl it through the window to escape the other patients are so caught up in his intoxicating spirit of freedom that they honestly believe he can do it despite the fact it would be impossible for a man much stronger than him when mcmurphy finally discovers that despite his best efforts he cannot lift the fountain he is so openly crushed that we cant help but feel for him beneath the frequent profanities and livewire antics there are real human emotions which come across as truly touchingwhat can be said about one flew over the cuckoos nest which hasnt already been said it has an excellent storyline top notch acting painfully bleak visuals perfectly setting the tone for the movie and alternates between being truly uplifting to devastatingly depressing it features perhaps the most memorable film ending ever next to a man on his horse riding off into the sunset and leaves the viewer beaten down by the conflicting emotions unaware what to think of the picture next to reveling in its glorious entirety its hard to produce a final outcome any better than this1010\n"

      "the archetypal action film seven samurai is also one of the richest works to ever be committed to celluloid each of its characters is extraordinarily realized each has his or her own arc his or her own vital part to play in the films slow progression towards its dramatic finale typically kurosawa has put the film together using an exceeding degree of artistry each and every shot each action sequence is exquisitely composed and yet none seems contrived or outofplace within the overall fabric of the work everything is beautifully conceived and in focus both literally and figurativelywhen watching seven samurai movie lovers will immediately recognize that several of its key elements can be readily detected in countless similar films made during the last halfcentury the audition scenes in which several samurai are recruited for the difficult task of defending a farming town from a group of bandits strikes a particularly familiar chord as do those showing the samurai training the lowly villagers to fight and use weapons indeed the theme of a highly experienced group of tough guys taking up the cause of the disenfranchised has become something of an action film cliche portions of which echo throughout the american western as well as its progeny think the dirty dozen the road warrior or even televisions the a teambut what really stands out in seven samurai are its characters they run the gamut from elder teacher to hopeful youth stoic warrior to undisciplined brigand kurosawa even finds room for a youthful romance not to mention the mix of poor and beleaguered townspeople he depicts within the setting of the town perhaps its no wonder the enemy bandits are virtually faceless there is so much conflict and passion present within the group of protagonists the villains need not be more than a vague threat through it all kurosawa never forgets who these people are and where they stand in comparison to one another obviously the samurai are for the most part samurai while the townspeople are merely peasants lacking even in funds to pay their noble defenders kurosawa deftly illustrates these class differences by having one peasant fear horribly for the honor of his daughter who he suspects will be lured by the wealth of the samurai and also by giving us one samurai who is no samurai at all but merely a peasant himself whose own farming village was in his youth destroyed by marauding warriors the film thus wraps a a portrait of class conflict in a cloak of solidarity the samurai unite to defend the poor peasants but the ending is not exactly happy for them nor are the peasants completely honorable we learn for instance that they have in the past murdered defeated samurai and looted their bodies and it becomes apparent late in the film that their claims of poverty are perhaps not as truthful as at first seemed apparentso why do the samurai defend them so valiantly for honor for love of adventure the answer to this question is left intentionally vague it is up to each viewer to draw his or her own conclusions it is to the films credit that it forces such questions upon us while never allowing them to cause the motivations of its characters to seem untruemodern viewers will find the action sequences of seven samurai to be restrained there are for instance no gladiator or braveheart moments in which limbs are visibly hacked off blood flies and speakers pound with booming audio but the action is wonderfully filmed and there is some early use of slow motion to accentuate key moments the 3 12 hour running time may also deter some but i find the length to be one of the films charms it takes its dear sweet time in exposing its riches and no single moment feels underdeveloped or awkward dont miss it1010\n",

      "the movie se7en starring brad pitt morgan freeman and gwyneth paltrow is by far one of the most inventive wellwritten and cerebral films in recent history the film blending a well put together combination of dark visual style intense plot development and polished acting remains tight and focused throughout from beginning to end never straying outwards into unimportant issues or resorting to typical hollywood clichés se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding and remain uncompromising and shocking thus satisfying the initial vision of the director david fincherthe story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer who inspired by dante alighieris seven deadly sins from the divine comedy sets out to preach about mans impurity and does so by targeting victims then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them se7en seemingly starts out as a typical cat and mouse detective story however it quickly develops into of a sort of modernmyth with good and evil taking centre stage the story is original on all counts and thrilling on all levels the most important aspect of se7en however is that it keeps the audience numerous steps behind its story as oppose to other thrillers which become predictable and bland by the end by keeping the audience in the dark the film remains fresh and original as it progresses se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved by the films conclusion the audience is as much apart of the film as the characters themselves and arrive at se7ens surprise ending without a single clue of it prior to it occurring se7ens poetic endingwhich will not be given away says a lot for the people behind the movie showing they are not afraid of going against the grain a rarity with films so nowadaysdirected brilliantly by david fincher and skillfully written by andrew kevin walker se7en is well crafted and ingeniously clever making it one of the greatest films of the 90s while se7en may not have garnered critical acclaim as such films as silence of the lambs se7en is undoubtedly as influential as any film to datescore 1010\n",

      "a long time ago in a galaxy far far awaypre reviewits writing started in january 1973 eight hours a day five days a week george lucas said by taking small notes inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization after many drafts he finally came to a satisfactory conclusionthen lucas presented star wars to the united artists but they refused to budget the film so he went to universal pictures the studio that financed american graffiti however it was rejected as the film concept was too strangesuddenly alan ladd jr head of 20th century fox appeared a man that trusted in lucas genius and thats how star wars became a realitythe shooting of the movie was full of mishaps problems with practical effects never done before a bad first edit of the movie but that didnt stop george from fulfilling his space opera due to those setbacks fox studios began to put pressure on lucas to finish the movie finally the movie was done on the eve of star wars release 20th century fox george lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse one way or another may 25 1977 would be a day they would never forgetreviewstar wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure it follows the journey and growth of the protagonist luke skywalker his journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the empire and the rebel alliance both parties are embroiled in a civil war the empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders these sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity it is oppression and repression of the masses the empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their powerone of the most important features of the movie are the special effects the use motion control was even superior to stanley kubricks revolutionary masterpiece 2001 a space odyssey thanks to the creation of the dykstraflex the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for star wars on 1976 along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design the movie became stylistically uniquethe story and the characters are original and relatable r2d2 and c3po the astromech as the optimistic adventurers desiring to move forward in direct opposition c3po the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations luke skywalker the brave hero often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey obiwan kenobi the wise master and moral guidance of our hero han solo the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity leia the damsel in distress a fearsome princess and general finally darth vader the most iconic character in the franchise the merciless tyrant in a black suit representing evil and final conflict of the journeythe film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer john williams who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifsthe visual composition is authentic as lucas wanted a nostalgic filtered look so he kept changing key lights for a flashing effect he used a loose nervous frame as in newsreels the dramatic center was displaced deflecting the eye to background activity which in later films would include poetically changing weather this first film gradually turned darker following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to hightech black white and steely gray this is authenticity is reflected in its most iconic shot the binary sunset sequence which establishes the narrative throughline of the story and the world it takes place in the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops lukes character as the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky he gazes towards the horizon his sense of longing for something more is palpable taking things further he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid but for as a new hopebooks such as the hero with a thousand faces by joseph campbell structured the story the war of vietnam inspired the battle between the rebels and the empire the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the jedi real shots of warplanes made the space battles real kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel akira kurosawas storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters fritz langs its iconic protocol droid and john ford westerns determined its soulthe fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed star wars to be compelling and human besides being located on a galaxy far far away1010\n",

      "my grandfather fought in ww2 somehow surviving dday he was apart of operation neptune and stormed the beaches of normandy he told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about he loved watching war movies not sure exactly why some about that soldier life never really leaves them i guess he absolutely hated pearl harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who dont know what to do in the event of being attacked he had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance soldiers dont take girlfriends on private plane rides and they most definitely know how to swim maybe ill give that movie a good ripping one daybut saving private ryan was a respectable i cant watch this reaction he said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like he said it was too realistic whether or not the story is based on real or fiction that intro was 100 realistic im not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before i watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather a scene he was technically in which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really iswar is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with my grandfather was not afraid of anything ive seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off the only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed his nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep this movie helped me understand why\n"

      "personally ive never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale what a surreal idea for a movie its hard to find an adequate description because i also dont want to spoil this in the slightest way but this film has a sense of otherness to it  for lack of a better word  like none ive ever seen and the strange mythical nature of this film  apart from the amazing artwork  is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me maybe the themes of the story dont feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some easternasian mythologies  to me this beautiful piece of wonder was something new and a profoundly moving experience outstanding animation funny weird scary and touching at the same time this unique work of art is one i cant recommend enough 10 out of 10favorite films httpwwwimdbcomlistmkjokvqlsbslesserknown masterpieces httpwwwimdbcomlistls070242495favorite tvshows reviewed httpwwwimdbcomlistls075552387favorite lowbudget and bmovies httpwwwimdbcomlistls054808375\n",

      "its not really a review but my attempt to explain how i interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated especially if the reason is that they didnt like the second half of itits much easier to understand the message of a movie when the good guys win or the bad guys get punished in the end im not saying that all hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values but still i believe that parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which theres a character with a clearer moral center whom audiences can easily relate to so i think its no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiencessome complained that they dont understand kitaeks motive for killing mr park but to fully appreciate this you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is crossing the lineits a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other peoples privacy or as one should mind ones own social position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position if interpreted as the latter meaning it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families respective dwellingsit would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner but the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if bong joonho chose such a path and he is too good a director not to see such a dangerinstead he chose to make mr park a reasonable enough character despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature he seems to treat kitaek fairly enough at first but he also warns the latter not to cross the line if kitaek attempts to pry into his private lifeat first it seems that its quite easy for kitaek and other members of his family to sneak into mr parks house in various roles and mingle with them kitaek even compliments how nice mr parks family is but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard when he was hiding under the table what mr park really thinks of him  almost a different species of the human being who doesnt even smell like himkitaeks final disillusionment came when mr park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his sons shock while virtually ignoring kitaeks daughters status whos dying on the ground spurting blood from the stab woundthat moment kitaek realizes how mr park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being but something much more insignificantand he also realizes the line that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour instead it is a line that can even determine the life of those lesser human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those proper human beingshowever easy it was for kitaeks family to sneak into mr parks house or however they try to socialize and mingle with mr parks family their existence is no better than that of a parasite which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the housewith such disillusionment and anger kitaek chose to kill mr park as a parasite could to its host and like a parasite he keeps hiding deep inside the dead hosts body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offspringsthe tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either mr parks or kitaeks personalities instead its a line drawn by an invisible hand separating those classes according to their respective social conditions which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners and that is what i believe to be the message this film is trying to conveyof course not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a carefree pastime that everyone can understandbut without if the movie didnt change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year\n",

      "ah the usual suspects my personal favorite movie of all time dont let my bias be a fool perhaps its not the best movie ever but its one that i never get tired ofif you like flash and bikinis and breathtaking camera angles you wont find them here usual suspects is not an epic and it doesnt pretend to be its a modestlybudgeted piece by a fresh director who later went on to do the xmen movies a far departurea great gritty script beautifullyacted characters and what many have called the greatest movie ending of all time are some of the shining qualities that make the usual suspects an object worthy of praise above its humblelooking shellthe casting is very unusual but somehow fits perfectly gabriel byrne is convincing as the excon trying to build a new life when he gets drawn back into his old life stephen baldwin has the role of his career as the smartmouthed and cocky professional kevin pollak takes a big departure from his usual good comedy self to take a more dramatic role benicio del toro literally takes a onedimensional character with absolutely nothing in the script to give him character and he fleshes it out with brilliant mannerisms and memorable mumbling to show incredible acting creativity kevin spacey as we know him was born from this movie his manners and fasttalking yet shy gimp nature are a treat to listen to throughout the flickwithout giving away the plot the best and most genius parts of the movie are the subtleties after you see the ending and the truth hits you like a ton of bricks you have to watch it again on the second time through youll jump up and point at the screen whenever you spot a clue you missed the first time its even possible to watch the movie multiple times and see something new with every viewing its that attention to detail that make the deceptively innocentlooking usual suspects one of the greatest movies of all time\n"

      "i saw harakiri seppuku in a new 35 mm print at nycs film forum this is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture writers shinobu hashimoto and yasuhiko takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by the count of monte cristo ambrose bierce and howard hawks westerns as much as by samurai literature and moviesthe film begins deceptively as a story within a story seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor such as in the conventional oftretold tale of the 47 ronin the context is set at a time when the central government the shogunate is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people notably their samurai forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse but the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from hiroshimavery gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tensionit is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity where a priority is put on family support education and creative productivity in comparison to the macho opening relationships with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier ritualized scenes in sharp relief particularly the recurring image of the clans armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbolthe psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure and those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century american can glean like downfall der untergang it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to world war iithe repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters the revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional japanese art including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfallthe over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining\n",

      "i can remember when this film came out i was adamantly against seeing it i had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic jewish holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the germans to add some flavourhow wrong i wasthis is one of the best films i have ever seen and what it did to me i cannot describe in words but in a nutshell it moved me made me cry made me feel like i was in the polish ghetto in 1940 and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as i walked out of the theater and thanked god that i live in the free society that i do roman polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like chinatown and rosemarys baby but this is his crowning achievement i think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film i believe that the oscars are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year it tells you that it should have won best picture but the weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone hence a charlatan like chicago takes top prize sorry for the digression here but when you compare a film like chicago to a masterpiece like the pianist there really is one clear cut winner they handed out the statue to the wrong moviethe pianist follows up and coming piano player wlad spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos surviving only by the kindness of strangers i think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because spielzman is a man that we can all relate to he is not a hero he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge he is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive he is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide and this is how i related to him if put in his position how would i react exactly the way he did this is a man that had everything taken from him his livelihood his family his freedom and almost his life there is no time for heroics here adrien brody embodies the spirit of spielzman and his win at this years oscars was one of the happiest moments i have had watching the festivities his speech was even better but that is a topic for another timeultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the german soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes ive witnessed with very little dialogue it is in the eyes the face the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know i think it is this scene that won brody his oscar this is one of the all time great performancesi think polanski spoke from the heart here he has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other i think the pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done chicago will be forgotten the way ordinary people was forgotten and when people talk about the film the pianist they will do so with reverence and respect this is a cinematic masterpiece10 out of 10\n"

      "ridley scotts gladiator is not a perfect film i would think that the hardiest of fans of which im firmly one know this deep down yet just like commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy so does gladiator the film enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the academy award acknowledgements it receivedin narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme something scott and russell crowe have never shied away from there has to my knowledge as well never been a denial of the debt gladiator owes to anthony manns 1964 epic the fall of the roman empire some folk seem very irritated by this which is strange because the makers of gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience and it bloody worked the influence and interest in all things roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post gladiators success is there for all to seewhat we do in life echoes in eternityso no originality in story then while some of the cgi is hardly grade a stuff and theres a little over  mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required yet the way gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel  overrides film making irks crowes maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with as he runs through the gamut of lifes pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations we are with him every step of the way urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny with crowe superb in every pained frame winning the academy award for best actor that he should have won for the insider the previous yearbacking crowe up is joaquin phoenix giving commodus preening villainy and connie nielsen graceful as lucilla pitch nielsens turn here against that of diane krugers in troy to see the class difference for historical period playing oliver reed leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as proximo the gladiator task master olly superb in both body and cgi soul richard harris tugging the heart strings derek jacobi classy david hemmings also while djimon hounso gives juba  maximus right hand man and confidante  a level of character gravitas thats inspiringi didnt know man could build such thingsdialogue is literate and poetic resplendent with iconic speeches action is never far away but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations the flaming arrows and blood letting of the germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity and scott and his team never sag from this standard the gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing the recreation for the battle of carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction and then the finale the culmination of two mens destinies no soft soaping from scott and crowe it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap a great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again bravo maximus decimus meridius 1010\n"

      "if there is one charlie chaplin film to recommend as others have pointed to in the past city lights is the one though chaplin played his tramp character superbly in other movies like modern times and the gold rush city lights displays the tramp at his funniest his bravest his most romantic and his most sympathetic its tough for filmmakers in recent days to bring the audience so close emotionally with the characters but its pulled off the film centers on three characters the tramp the quintessential funny homeless man who blends into the crowd but gets caught in predicaments he helps a drunken businessman myers a fine performance in his own right from suicide and becomes his on and off again friend that is when it suits him and doesnt notice his friends state the other person in the tramps life is the blind flower girl virginia cherrill one of the most absorbing beautiful and key female performances in silent film who are quite fond of each other despite the lack of total perception the emotional centerpiece comes in obtaining rent and eye surgery money which leads to a how else can i put it magical boxing match where its basically a 180 from the brutality and viscerality of a match in say raging bull though there is no dialog the film achieves a timelessness its essentially a tale of two loners who find each other lose each other and find each other again the last scene widely discussed by critics for decades is moving if not tearinducing and its never ever boring once you get along with the tramp you find the little things about him the reaction shots the little things he does after the usual big gag look to the ballroom scene for examples of this or when he gets a bottle of wine poured down his pants without the other guy noticing truth be told if this film makes you indifferent never watch chaplin again but if you give yourself to the film you may find its one of the most charming from the era or perhaps any era\n",

      "do not look at this through the prism of foreign films youd be wasting your time and miss something far too importanthollywood does scale like nobody else leaving the competition gasping in its wake france does intimacy and brutality nothing is sacred and rather than try to revive the new wave or emulate hollywood like most widely seen french films of late intouchables harnesses its core strengths  ease with intimacy willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty  and delivers one of the funniest most honest and touching films i have ever seensy is a failed robber going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body the circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here but meet they do and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each otherthe films simplicity is delightfully misleading the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing and however good the rest of the cast is the central duo is magical sys comic timing will have you in stitches but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character cluzet isnt your typical sadsack instead much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit youll know it when you see itthis is one of the most unique beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film it will make you laugh it will make you cry a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile\n",

      "its hard to believe this movie is from 1968 very modern way of filming for the time sergio leone gave time to each scene something that new directors seem afraid to do great story about the last days of an era amazing music and the originality of linking a specific melody to each main character and all these closeup to characters eyes just a wonderful movie\n"

      "there are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on imdb  many of them exhort its greatness  i dont disagree with thembut id like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who havent seen this film  id like to tell you how to watch itthe people who made this movie didnt think they were producing a masterpiece bergman left the shoot disgusted  the screenwriters were on salary for warners writing half a dozen movies a year and this was just one more  bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse careerso as an audience member you cant sit down expecting gilded greatnessdont have a casablaca party  dont watch it on your first date hoping it will lend that romantic touch  dont watch it as part of your i need to watch the best 10 movies of all time film school projectbuy this movie on dvd  have it at the ready  and then one friday night when your plans fall through and you find its 1030pm and theres nothing on tv thats any good open a six pack of beer or pour yourself some wine and watch this movie in a darkened roomthe characters in casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism  every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses  as rick says three little people dont amount to a hill of beans in this big old world  if youre in a mood where you understand what hes saying watch this movie and it will transport youthere is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time  because movies when all is said and done dont amount to a hill of beans  they are meant to entertain us not for us to worship thembut no movie has ever known this fact like casablanca\n",

      "tiempos modernos modern times es un largometraje de drama y comedia estrenado en el año de 1936 y que fue escrita dirigida y protagonizada por charles chaplin siendo esta cinta una de las pocas en las que se puede escuchar claramente la voz del actor constituyendo así una mezcla muy entretenida entre el cine mudo y el cine sonoro\n",
      "la película tiene como protagonistas principales a charles chaplin quien interpreta el personaje de un explotado trabajador industrial y a paulette goddard que hace el papel de una chica huérfana con la que chaplin se encontrará y pasaran ciertas aventuras juntos sin embargo tendrán que enfrentarse ante una sociedad industrializada llena de problemas personas y exigencias que no los dejaran cumplir sus sueños y fantasías de una vida feliz\n",
      "si bien el filme no cuenta con la personificación de un antagonista como tal se podría decir que chaplin busca proyectar que el verdadero enemigo de los personajes es el sistema capitalista y a base de las maquinas en el que viven siendo esto lo que provoca que los trabajadores sean explotados hasta más no poder para así arruinar sus vidas siendo abordado en el filme de una manera cómica cuando el protagonista es hospitalizado\n",
      "en este sentido se podría decir que la película se desarrolla posiblemente entre los años después del gran crack de 1929 en los estados unidos una época en la cual muchos empleados quedaron sin trabajo y tuvieron que verse en situaciones difíciles para sobrevivir dejando muchas veces su felicidad a un lado \n",
      "esto se menciona porque dentro del filme se ven diferentes hechos en los que los trabajadores realizan manifestaciones en busca de libertad y de sus derechos laborales pero que son oprimidos por la policía e incluso se puede observar como las demandas de trabajo son inmensas y que si no tienen la suerte necesaria o alguna referencia de otras personas se vuelve difícil tener una oportunidad \n",
      "por lo que el punto central de los personajes se basa en la búsqueda de la felicidad pero que de acuerdo a lo que les ha hecho creer la sociedad es que para conseguir esa felicidad necesitan dinero y que para tener dinero necesitan trabajar ardua e incansablemente un mensaje que se desarrolla a lo largo de la película pero que no resulta pesado o aburrido\n",
      "y que es una cinta que no posee sorprendentes detalles estéticos gusta entretiene y transmite el mensaje sutilmente gracias a la interpretación cómica y a base de gestos con los que actúa charles chaplin quien es también fue el encargado de realizar el sonido para la película\n",
      "en relación a esto es sorprende que si bien el filme no cuenta con diálogos como tal para impulsar el mensaje sino solo frases sueltas en ciertos momentos la sonorización y los efectos de sonido cumplen el papel de transmitir las emociones y sensaciones al público junto a las actuaciones por lo que el sonido va más allá de solo ambientar sino que funciona como complemento de la idea general que se busca transmitir \n",
      "en este aspecto se vuelve interesante la apuesta que se hace entre el cine sonoro y el cine mudo ya que constituyen una mezcla de dos momentos importantes para el desarrollo de este arte así mismo da curiosidad pensar sobre el impacto que tuvo esta película de drama y comedia en las personas de ese tiempo \n",
      "además esta es una cinta que se desarrolla a las puertas de una segunda guerra mundial y después de una crisis económica por lo que de alguna manera la película es bastante revolucionaria tanto técnicamente como en el mensaje que busca transmitir ya que incluso hasta estas fechas los temas que aborda siguen teniendo vigencia o son bastante similares a los que se ilustran en la historia\n",
      "una historia que se presenta de una forma bastante interesante ya que desde las primeras escenas se puede ver como el director intenta hacer una comparación entre los animales y los humanos al mostrar imágenes de cerdos que se desvanecen sobre una toma con personas \n",
      "de esta manera la película logra conectar y contar una historia fluida de una ficción de la realidad abordada desde la diversión con un guión que se basa solo en la presentación de los personajes sin profundizar tanto en lo que ellos y enfrascándose en lo que ellos buscan del mundo\n",
      "una historia que prevalece a pesar de ser tiempos modernos diferentes y que muestra que muchos problemas solo se siguen repitiendo una y otra vez a lo largo del tiempo sin embargo al final de la película el director logra transmitir el mensaje que posiciona el amor sobre todo ya que a pesar de no tener nada ambos personajes se tienen el uno para el otro apoyándose mutuamente y sobreviviendo juntos\n",
      "tiempos modernos fue y sigue siendo una película bastante adelantada a su tiempo con respecto a la forma con la que chaplin logra transmitir el mensaje esto porque su producto entretiene y hasta estas sigue haciéndolo gracias a su uso de la comedia y su forma de narrar la historia de una cinta que fue estrenada en 1936 por lo que es importante hacer una reflexión individual sobre hacia a donde vamos nosotros como personas dentro de una sociedad llena de exigencias y ante revoluciones industriales y tecnológicas\n"

escrita dirigida y protagonizada por charles chaplin siendo esta cinta una de las pocas en las que se puede escuchar claramente la voz del actor constituyendo así una mezcla muy entretenida entre el cine mudo y el cine sonoro\\nla película tiene como protagonistas principales a charles chaplin quien interpreta el personaje de un explotado trabajador industrial y a paulette goddard que hace el papel de una chica huérfana con la que chaplin se encontrará y pasaran ciertas aventuras juntos sin embargo tendrán que enfrentarse ante una sociedad industrializada llena de problemas personas y exigencias que no los dejaran cumplir sus sueños y fantasías de una vida feliz\\nsi bien el filme no cuenta con la personificación de un antagonista como tal se podría decir que chaplin busca proyectar que el verdadero enemigo de los personajes es el sistema capitalista y a base de las maquinas en el que viven siendo esto lo que provoca que los trabajadores sean explotados hasta más no poder para así arruinar sus vidas siendo abordado en el filme de una manera cómica cuando el protagonista es hospitalizado\\nen este sentido se podría decir que la película se desarrolla posiblemente entre los años después del gran crack de 1929 en los estados unidos una época en la cual muchos empleados quedaron sin trabajo y tuvieron que verse en situaciones difíciles para sobrevivir dejando muchas veces su felicidad a un lado \\nesto se menciona porque dentro del filme se ven diferentes hechos en los que los trabajadores realizan manifestaciones en busca de libertad y de sus derechos laborales pero que son oprimidos por la policía e incluso se puede observar como las demandas de trabajo son inmensas y que si no tienen la suerte necesaria o alguna referencia de otras personas se vuelve difícil tener una oportunidad \\npor lo que el punto central de los personajes se basa en la búsqueda de la felicidad pero que de acuerdo a lo que les ha hecho creer la sociedad es que para conseguir esa felicidad necesitan dinero y que para tener dinero necesitan trabajar ardua e incansablemente un mensaje que se desarrolla a lo largo de la película pero que no resulta pesado o aburrido\\ny que es una cinta que no posee sorprendentes detalles estéticos gusta entretiene y transmite el mensaje sutilmente gracias a la interpretación cómica y a base de gestos con los que actúa charles chaplin quien es también fue el encargado de realizar el sonido para la película\\nen relación a esto es sorprende que si bien el filme no cuenta con diálogos como tal para impulsar el mensaje sino solo frases sueltas en ciertos momentos la sonorización y los efectos de sonido cumplen el papel de transmitir las emociones y sensaciones al público junto a las actuaciones por lo que el sonido va más allá de solo ambientar sino que funciona como complemento de la idea general que se busca transmitir \\nen este aspecto se vuelve interesante la apuesta que se hace entre el cine sonoro y el cine mudo ya que constituyen una mezcla de dos momentos importantes para el desarrollo de este arte así mismo da curiosidad pensar sobre el impacto que tuvo esta película de drama y comedia en las personas de ese tiempo \\nademás esta es una cinta que se desarrolla a las puertas de una segunda guerra mundial y después de una crisis económica por lo que de alguna manera la película es bastante revolucionaria tanto técnicamente como en el mensaje que busca transmitir ya que incluso hasta estas fechas los temas que aborda siguen teniendo vigencia o son bastante similares a los que se ilustran en la historia\\nuna historia que se presenta de una forma bastante interesante ya que desde las primeras escenas se puede ver como el director intenta hacer una comparación entre los animales y los humanos al mostrar imágenes de cerdos que se desvanecen sobre una toma con personas \\nde esta manera la película logra conectar y contar una historia fluida de una ficción de la realidad abordada desde la diversión con un guión que se basa solo en la presentación de los personajes sin profundizar tanto en lo que ellos y enfrascándose en lo que ellos buscan del mundo\\nuna historia que prevalece a pesar de ser tiempos modernos diferentes y que muestra que muchos problemas solo se siguen repitiendo una y otra vez a lo largo del tiempo sin embargo al final de la película el director logra transmitir el mensaje que posiciona el amor sobre todo ya que a pesar de no tener nada ambos personajes se tienen el uno para el otro apoyándose mutuamente y sobreviviendo juntos\\ntiempos modernos fue y sigue siendo una película bastante adelantada a su tiempo con respecto a la forma con la que chaplin logra transmitir el mensaje esto porque su producto entretiene y hasta estas sigue haciéndolo gracias a su uso de la comedia y su forma de narrar la historia de una cinta que fue estrenada en 1936 por lo que es importante hacer una reflexión individual sobre hacia a donde vamos nosotros como personas dentro de una sociedad llena de exigencias y ante revoluciones industriales y tecnológicas')\n",

chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room the film begins with the end of the trial the jurors retire to deliberate the case a preliminary vote is taken and the result is 111 in favour of the guilty verdict eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father only juror 8 has doubts at first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes rightfully that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror 8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit as time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all but not everyone is easy to convincealthough the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors the character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting excellent dialogue and nearflawless actingjuror 1  a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out he appears at ease only once during the film  when he talks about football he has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury  a task he clearly does not relishjuror 2  a small quite man clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance apparently he finds solace in his job  he is an accountantjuror 3  probably the most complex personality in the film starts off like a pleasant selfmade successful businessman he analyses the case impartially explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured as time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case  he also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability wonderfully played by lee j cobb  this is the character you remember after the film is overjuror 4  self assured slightly arrogant stockbroker obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but as one of the jurors says  this is not an exact science he does not take into account the feelings the passions the characters of the people involved in the case he is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off it is a very hot dayjuror 5  here is a man under great emotional stress he comes from the same social background as the accused boy  with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty  he does not want compassion to influence him  so ironically it doesjuror 6  a simple man quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations but he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistakejuror 7  the only one that really has no opinion on this case literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case  he talks of baseball of the heat of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever  he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think its worth the botherjuror 8 a caring man has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors he tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible oddsjuror 9  a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the casejuror 10  the most horrifying character in the film votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boys social background the tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boys  which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the differencejuror 11  an immigrant watchmaker careful methodical man well mannered and soft spoken respects the right of people to have different opinion to his  and is willing to look at both sides of the problem loses his temper only once  horrified by the complete indifference of juror 7juror 12  a young business type  perhaps he has his own opinions  but is careful to hide them what he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people thinkthe film succeeds in doing something very rare today  developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable memorable and distinct characters')\n",

their dialogue is witty and entertaining and its also disarming because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal if you didnt know better you might assume these were regular guys having chitchat on their way to work other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims their talk has no relevance to anything in the film or to anything else for that matter yet without such scenes pulp fiction wouldnt be pulp fiction i get the sense that tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully texturedits no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase reading far more into the story than tarantino probably intended the film is so intricately structured with so many astonishing details many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation but there is no deeper explanation pulp fiction is as the title indicates purely an exercise in technique and style albeit a brilliant and layered one containing numerous references to other films it is like a great work of abstract art or art about art it has all the characteristics we associate with great movies fine writing firstrate acting unforgettable characters and one of the most wellconstructed narratives ive ever seen in a film but to what end the selfcontained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itselfthe movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that its essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie but something always goes wrong some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures tarantinos originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead even if they move the story away from conventional plot developmentsperhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions indeed the whole film seems to consist of digressions no character ever says anything in a simple straightforward manner jules could have simply told yolanda be cool and no ones going to get hurt which is just the type of line youd find in a generic runofthemill action flick instead he goes off on a tangent about what fonzie is like tarantino savors every word of his characters finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references but the lines arent just witty they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior think of mias statement to vincent thats when you know youve found somebody special when you can just shut the f up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silencewhat is the movies purpose exactly im not sure but it does deal a lot with the theme of power marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time the whole point of the big date sequence which happens to be my favorite section of the film is the power that marsellus has over his men without even being present this power is what gets vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away the power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film its liberal use of the nword in this film the word isnt just used as an epithet to describe blacks jules for instance at one point applies the term to vincent it has more to do with power than with race the powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters most of these gangsters are not racist in practice indeed they are intermingled racially and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many lawabiding citizens in our society they resort to racial epithets because its a patter that establishes their separateness from the noncriminal worldtheres a nice moral progression to the stories we presume that vincent hesitates to sleep with mia out of fear rather than loyalty later butchs act of heroism could be motivated by honor but were never sure the film ends however with jules making a clear moral choice thus the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for selfpreservationstill its hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories none of the stories are really about anything they certainly are not about hitmen pontificating about burgers nor is the film really a satire or a farce although it contains elements of both at times it feels like a tale that didnt need to be told but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind or of any other kind')\n",

norton is an insomniac office worker who lives a materialistic life from the very beginning the movie comments on the capitalist nature of society by portraiting how consumerism moves the world but is unable to give relief in the end flipping through catalogues of new furnite for his apartment were the narrators only personality trait to fight against his insomnia he starts attending to support groups by lying to people pretending he has conditions he does not have the narrator finds relief  the emotional acceptance he finds in the support groups is enough to allow him to sleep at night the emotional complexity of the character is nothing unrealistic david fincher makes a subtle yet clear comment on the nature of materialist societies where no one really listens to each other nor care about each other the system doesnt care about anyone the distance between people  especially enhanced by how they function in the capitalist world  is a major plot point however when the narrator is finds someone whos a faker just like him he loses his emotional escape   her lie reflected my lie suddenly i felt nothing i couldnt cry so once again i couldnt sleepshortly after tyler durden brad pitt is introduced into the story the main character loses everything he valued deprived of his possessions he seeks solace in the company of a man who is the polar opposite of what he is if the narrator is a worker whos way too worried about his condo and his job tyler is a freewheeling soapmaker who couldnt care less about all those things the contrast between them is clear tyler refuses any consumerist logic from the narrator whilst making he see how futile is the lifestyle he was leading  right we are consumers were the byproducts of a lifestyle obsession the characters here portraid are so different because one of them is free while the other is not tyler in a nihilistic way helps the narrator realize that his existence is meaningless enough  something that is clearly displayed in the capitalist world  that all they can do is giving up everything the selfdestruction promoted by the fight club is ironically what allows the narrator  as well as many other frustrated men  to find solace in their mundane life little by little the narrator is stripping himself off his previous beliefs about job about behavior and the value of things its interesting to note that the narrator doesnt quit his job immediately picturing how hard it is actually to cut ties with the system  he eventually does thoughmany subtopics are discussed through the movie we see the narrator and tyler now living together talking about many things they talk about how both had an absent father how both lacked a sense of direction in life at some point and were told to follow the common sense  he says get a job so im 25 i call again and say now what he says i dunno get married the nature of the system we live in tells us what to do since the moment were born while both of them agree on that they also agree that this is all a great waste of time its important to notice though that both them had no significant connections with other people especially with women as tyler comments  were a generation of men raised by women im wondering if another woman is really the answer we needas the club grows the movie delves even deeper in those reflections about what really matters in life  advertising has us chasing cars and clothes working jobs we hate so we can buy st we dont need tyler becomes the source of inspiration for everyone who attends to the fight club everyone is much more like the narrator but theyre striving to be more like him at some point tyler decides that the club is meant to be something bigger  what he would call project mayhem while the original fight club was something kept like a secret idealized to give some sort of freedom through selfdestruction to its members project mayhem is about declaring a fight against the system the frustrated collective consciousness was the straw that broke the camels back  weve all been raised on television to believe that one day wed all be millionaires and movie gods and rock stars but we wont and were slowly learning that fact and were very very pied off however the narrator starts to slowly go against what tyler was meaning to do  kinda of recalling a bit of his past self and a sort of respect for the authority of society  and when this happen its the moment the movie reaches its climaxthe genius of the movie is displayed when we discover that tyler durden and the narrator are the same person they have always been the same person due to his declining mental health and his rather meaningless life he created an alterego  someone capable of manifesting everything he wasnt as a system abiding person the contrast created by tylers different personalities is amazing to watch as the truth unfolds and the ambivalence created when we discover the truth about tyler durden is even more marvelous this movie portraits very well how a person can reach the extremes of their mind in a system that overlooks the relevance of your very existence  when you become just a number just a braindead member of society having your hopes and wishes constantly ignored in the end tyler recovers his sanity only to see that his actions cant be reverted  so he only stands by and watches the final scene is beautiful what could be bettar than watching the system crumbling before your eyes while where is my mind plays this movie is a masterpiece and it is so entrancing because of how real it is  in the end the movie shows many things we know and think but tend to keep hidden it is provocative funny and thrilling and most importantly it is so damn real the plot aged perfectly and i dont think it is

been done so sophisticatedly i do believe the rumour that nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of inception in my opinion its been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writerdirector career i jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of nolans remarkable works\\nmemento as his first signature in the cinema history is tremendous and has stayed the most mindbending film ive ever seen but overall it doesnt reach the same level of inceptionthe prestige is highly impressive but somehow i havent been able to find the very particular nolans spirit in

with his lifetimerole the uniqueandonly jokerthen there came inception where nolan truly stood out having every single detail of his work done in the finest way the multilayered storyline despite its complexity remains consistent and originally interesting from visual aspect everything was masterly handled an impeccable crosscutting allowed the movie to follow nolans nonlinear storytelling without being scattered a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visualeffects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes some of them i believe will stay in the audiences mind for a long time city bending in paris zerogravity fight in limbo dreams collapsing in addition nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messageslater we had interstellar

here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilersit is set in the world where theres technology that allows people to literally share dream there is in this world a new kind of corporate spy  extractors who use this technology to infiltrate the targets subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world our hero mr cobb leonardo dicaprio a very wellknown extractor and his partner arthur joseph gordonlevitt are approached by a powerful businessman  mr saito ken watanabe for a nearly impossible mission something no one has ever done before  instead of steeling he wants them to plant an idea in a persons subconscious which is also called inception in return saito offers something that cobb could never resist a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him so cobb and arthur gather a team to carry out the mission eames tom hardy  a veteran identity forger yusuf  the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3levels dream within a dream and ariadne ellen page  a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission the target is robert fischer cillian murphy  son and heir of saitos biggest competitor maurice fischer whos dying the goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his fathers business and the team has to carry saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception while the team go deeper and deeper into fischers mind we discover gradually the dark of cobbs past as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero why he has became such an expert of inception and what is his desperate motivation for taking that insane missionthe movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life in cobbs case its the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife mal marion cotillard and his regrets so as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife it will keep coming back and haunt his present the deeper the team go into dream the more dangerous his subconscious under the form of his ghostly wife comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission indeed if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story the ending scene makes perfect sense yes were now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history did cobb find mr saito in limbo bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world or they are still stuck in limbo  the infinite dream world and the last scene was just his big dream but all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story the result of inception mission when we perceive the story in its deeper layer as a journey for cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and refind the meaning of his life this ending did fulfill its job cobb didnt even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didnt care any more whats important to him is that he gonna be with his kids he did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on and that matters and after all dream or reality the importance is to truly live so from this point of view he has solved the maze of his life\\nsome short lines about the cast\\nleo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in shutter island and blood diamondjoseph gordonlevitt could have been more intense given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie zerogravity sequencethere was something missing in ken watanabes performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission maybe it was his englishtom hardy was ok but forgettable because his character didnt have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen timeellen page was really impressive she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect and personally i did find a lot of charms in her actingcillian murphy has also done a great job much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission his character robert fischer at the end was not so different than our hero cobb they both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze if for cobb it was the painful past with his late wife for fischer it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dadlast but not least the one who impressed me the most was marion mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way mostly with her speaking eyes and for me she is the most remarkable character of the movie')\n",
