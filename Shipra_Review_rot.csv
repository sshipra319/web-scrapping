https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/us_2019/reviews?type=user,"['horror', 'mysteryandthriller']",i dont know why the movie critics and the tomato meter were so generous with rating this movie i dont particularly rate movie critics views that highly anyway but this was crap thats all i need to say
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/toy_story_4/reviews?type=user,"['fantasy', 'kidsandfamily', 'animation', 'adventure', 'comedy']",a heartwarming and funny toy story movie but its not as good as the three films because the characters feel more brave and smarter in the three previous films
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lady_bird/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'comedy']",meh was ok ronan is always good to watch and doesnt disappoint but if youre not an impoverished quite bright but nongenius glee girl struggling with your identity in a feepaying catholic school in sacramento that your parents cant afford youll probably struggle to relate passed the time wont be rushing to watch it again
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/citizen_kane/reviews?type=user,['drama'],my sound was messed up halfway through but pretty incredible this movie was made in the 40s
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mission_impossible_fallout/reviews?type=user,"['adventure', 'mysteryandthriller', 'action']",ive never like the mission impossible series as much as bond or borne but i do sort of like this type of movie i think the previous one was extremely good this one seemed kind of bland by comparison a lot of the action scenes seemed like repeats of things that have been done many times before and the ending scenes especially seemed a bit forced to create extra drama some of the characters that seemed quirky or engaging in the previous movie were a bit more bland in this one in this story the team is supposed to get some rogue plutonium when it is stolen from under their noses they spend the rest of the movie trying to get it back the plot is a bit confusing and implausible at times to the point that you dont end up getting very invested in everything that is going on towards the end there is an odd addition of a storyline about a love interest from ethans past that seems a bit tacked on overall this edition of mission impossible is not as engaging as some of the others have been it is enough to be entertaining for a couple hours of viewing but it probably will not be considered a classic

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003707-casablanca/reviews?type=user,['drama'],this classic never gets old  a definite must see for any movie buff
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/moonlight_2016/reviews?type=user,['drama'],stunning and incredibly personal and somewhat relatable story the movie is very subtle in its messaging and meaning in the sense that it wont ever spell out what its trying to say to you but if you are in the mood to listen then it has something really important to share
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_star_is_born_2018/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'music', 'romance']",a neargreat movie  cant quite put my finger why it wasnt quite up to a 5star par but the chemistry of the 2 leads isnt quite there  best scene the debut of the oscarwinning song shallows

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_farewell_2019/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'comedy']",a tender loving story that is filled with life although the subject matter is enough to make you sad it is handled with care by director lulu wang it is sad but just the right amount of humorous it is an understated movie in many ways but incredibly powerful highlighting the limited time that we have on this planet and the ways that we should spend it definite mustwatch
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_quiet_place_2018/reviews?type=user,"['horror', 'mysteryandthriller']",movie was dope excited for part 2
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/modern_times/reviews?type=user,['comedy'],"tiempos modernos modern times es un largometraje de drama y comedia estrenado en el año de 1936 y que fue escrita dirigida y protagonizada por charles chaplin siendo esta cinta una de las pocas en las que se puede escuchar claramente la voz del actor constituyendo así una mezcla muy entretenida entre el cine mudo y el cine sonoro
la película tiene como protagonistas principales a charles chaplin quien interpreta el personaje de un explotado trabajador industrial y a paulette goddard que hace el papel de una chica huérfana con la que chaplin se encontrará y pasaran ciertas aventuras juntos sin embargo tendrán que enfrentarse ante una sociedad industrializada llena de problemas personas y exigencias que no los dejaran cumplir sus sueños y fantasías de una vida feliz
si bien el filme no cuenta con la personificación de un antagonista como tal se podría decir que chaplin busca proyectar que el verdadero enemigo de los personajes es el sistema capitalista y a base de las maquinas en el que viven siendo esto lo que provoca que los trabajadores sean explotados hasta más no poder para así arruinar sus vidas siendo abordado en el filme de una manera cómica cuando el protagonista es hospitalizado
en este sentido se podría decir que la película se desarrolla posiblemente entre los años después del gran crack de 1929 en los estados unidos una época en la cual muchos empleados quedaron sin trabajo y tuvieron que verse en situaciones difíciles para sobrevivir dejando muchas veces su felicidad a un lado 
esto se menciona porque dentro del filme se ven diferentes hechos en los que los trabajadores realizan manifestaciones en busca de libertad y de sus derechos laborales pero que son oprimidos por la policía e incluso se puede observar como las demandas de trabajo son inmensas y que si no tienen la suerte necesaria o alguna referencia de otras personas se vuelve difícil tener una oportunidad 
por lo que el punto central de los personajes se basa en la búsqueda de la felicidad pero que de acuerdo a lo que les ha hecho creer la sociedad es que para conseguir esa felicidad necesitan dinero y que para tener dinero necesitan trabajar ardua e incansablemente un mensaje que se desarrolla a lo largo de la película pero que no resulta pesado o aburrido
y que es una cinta que no posee sorprendentes detalles estéticos gusta entretiene y transmite el mensaje sutilmente gracias a la interpretación cómica y a base de gestos con los que actúa charles chaplin quien es también fue el encargado de realizar el sonido para la película
en relación a esto es sorprende que si bien el filme no cuenta con diálogos como tal para impulsar el mensaje sino solo frases sueltas en ciertos momentos la sonorización y los efectos de sonido cumplen el papel de transmitir las emociones y sensaciones al público junto a las actuaciones por lo que el sonido va más allá de solo ambientar sino que funciona como complemento de la idea general que se busca transmitir 
en este aspecto se vuelve interesante la apuesta que se hace entre el cine sonoro y el cine mudo ya que constituyen una mezcla de dos momentos importantes para el desarrollo de este arte así mismo da curiosidad pensar sobre el impacto que tuvo esta película de drama y comedia en las personas de ese tiempo 
además esta es una cinta que se desarrolla a las puertas de una segunda guerra mundial y después de una crisis económica por lo que de alguna manera la película es bastante revolucionaria tanto técnicamente como en el mensaje que busca transmitir ya que incluso hasta estas fechas los temas que aborda siguen teniendo vigencia o son bastante similares a los que se ilustran en la historia
una historia que se presenta de una forma bastante interesante ya que desde las primeras escenas se puede ver como el director intenta hacer una comparación entre los animales y los humanos al mostrar imágenes de cerdos que se desvanecen sobre una toma con personas 
de esta manera la película logra conectar y contar una historia fluida de una ficción de la realidad abordada desde la diversión con un guión que se basa solo en la presentación de los personajes sin profundizar tanto en lo que ellos y enfrascándose en lo que ellos buscan del mundo
una historia que prevalece a pesar de ser tiempos modernos diferentes y que muestra que muchos problemas solo se siguen repitiendo una y otra vez a lo largo del tiempo sin embargo al final de la película el director logra transmitir el mensaje que posiciona el amor sobre todo ya que a pesar de no tener nada ambos personajes se tienen el uno para el otro apoyándose mutuamente y sobreviviendo juntos
tiempos modernos fue y sigue siendo una película bastante adelantada a su tiempo con respecto a la forma con la que chaplin logra transmitir el mensaje esto porque su producto entretiene y hasta estas sigue haciéndolo gracias a su uso de la comedia y su forma de narrar la historia de una cinta que fue estrenada en 1936 por lo que es importante hacer una reflexión individual sobre hacia a donde vamos nosotros como personas dentro de una sociedad llena de exigencias y ante revoluciones industriales y tecnológicas"
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eighth_grade/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'comedy']",a unique coming of age film set in the modern world awkward but touching
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/it_happened_one_night/reviews?type=user,['romance'],afi 100 greatest films  35 this is a film i knew nothing about and went into this with only the very short description on the tcm listing as background knowledge the brief synopsis under the title listing made this film sound more like a mysterysuspense when i read it so i was surprised and thrown off by the quirky and playful tone early into the picture not realizing i was actually watching one of the original romcoms it isnt hard to see why this was the first film to take home the big four at the academy awards as the directing and acting from the two leads was so in sync and i imagine quite groundbreaking for that time as elements of this film are still seen prevalently in romantic comedies today definitely not my favorite film or genre but one definitely that would be hard not to appreciate and respect
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/booksmart/reviews?type=user,['comedy'],a great movie that deals with teenage life if you have a teenager watch this movie with them

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_third_man/reviews?type=user,['mysteryandthriller'],a quirky joy unique even hover half a century later with solid characters mystery progression and atmospheric noir tone all made fresh with the bizarre usage of a ukulele in the soundtrack 9510

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_shape_of_water_2017/reviews?type=user,"['fantasy', 'romance']",i wouldnt normally expect to enjoy a movie of this description but decided to watch it after seeing the amount of awards it was nominated for and received im so glad i did a beautifully produced film a mixture of scifi  edge of your seat drama fantastic characters good and evil romance beautiful but innocent and a wonderful portrayal of humanity fighting evil
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spotlight_2015/reviews?type=user,['drama'],spotlight is surprisingly a very well made movie though much of the movie is talking and investigation it finds a way to really grip you into wanting to know the truth as much as the team does such a crazy story cant believe it happened everywhere the entire cast gave out amazing performances interesting film
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/selma/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'history']",except for the portrayal of lyndon b johnson this was an exceptional film david oyelowo is incredible as martin luther king jr that its shocking to believe he wasnt nominated for an oscar

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_grande_illusion/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'war']",this is a lyrical and deeply humane story of prisoners their captors and their escape of the end of the old european order and its aristocracy of the deep goodness inside individuals and in spite of that goodness of the madness of our societies  it is a film clearly against war and nationalism and renoir paints a loving picture of both aristocrats and commoners  eric von stroheims performance is indelible unforgettable
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/arrival_2016/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'scifi', 'mysteryandthriller']",the whole cast are terrific but amy adams is outstanding a must for any scifi fan
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/singin_in_the_rain/reviews?type=user,"['comedy', 'musical']",singin in the rain is the best musical ever made even by todays standards the production and talent is unparalleled you cant call yourself a film buff if you havent seen this movies the main score of singin in the rain when gene kelly is dancing down the street so in love that he doesnt mind the down pour is enough to touch anyones heart this movie will always remain one of my alltime favorites and a great hollywood masterpiece

https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/logan_2017/reviews?type=user,"['fantasy', 'adventure', 'action']",shallow and empty by the end this movie was as full of plotholes as logan was of actual holes the only thing i wanted to know is what was killing logan and what dr xavier did that messed everything up the answer to the first is lame and there isnt even an answer to the second because they hope their audience will just fill in the gap lazy i went in this ready to love it i came out wondering what the fuck i wasted 2 hours on
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_cabinet_of_dr_caligari/reviews?type=user,['horror'],this classic is worth watching  the dvd i saw also had a german documentary about their film history  dr c is more than terror its about cultural shift
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/double_indemnity/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'crime']","this is where the blueprint of the greedy unscrupulous wife originated
double indemnity has been imitated but never properly duplicated

one of the great billy wilders best films it never quite reached the level of recognition it probably deserved it never won an academy award its actors were at the time felt to be miscast

and now over 75 years after its making it appears obvious that double indemnity cannot possibly be remade to capture the essence of what it was"
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_favourite_2018/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'comedy']","i want to tell you a little bit about this movieits such a thought provoking filmqueen anne was the first ruler of the newly united great britain in the early 1700s the last stuart monarch before the hanoverian dynasty thats still with us god save the queenso theres your story
here the widowed childless semiinvalid anne is a lonely eccentric figure stuck in the gilded cage of her palace who leaves the managing of national affairs to her childhood friend the formidable sarah churchill
sarah is the wife of john churchill head of the armed forces and of another dynasty thats still with us the duke of marlborough as john is also known is off fighting the french comme de tradition and one of sarahs jobs is to bully parliament into keeping his war funded
sarah then is pretty much in charge until the arrival of a impoverished cousin abigail who seeks work as a servant abigail then sets about working her way up the hierarchy all the way to the queens bedchamber
yet overall the favourite is an extremely boring film thats poorly made unfortunately not as weird as what ive come to expect from lanthimos but still compelling gorgeous and irreverent even darkly funny by timesthis witty complexpowerful bawdy and occasionally absurdist story of court politics is great fun despite some gratingly annoying music
but in some places there is very slow movement which is very annoying
and probably accurate at least in showing how fragile both power and social status were in that era but i would recommend watching this one because its very breathtaking film"
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_sick/reviews?type=user,['romance'],it took me a little while to get into it but it eventually pulled me in and i laughed several times i went into it without knowing much beforehand and i had no idea it was based on the reallife story of the lead actor until the pictures at the end i thought ray romano was particularly great in this it has some charm to it
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spider_man_far_from_home/reviews?type=user,"['fantasy', 'adventure', 'action', 'comedy']","sweet funny charming action packed romantic and suspenseful  this one has it all spiderman far from home is an awesome superhero scifi fantasy you have got to watch
mysterio is a classic character from the comic books who is perfectly brought to life in one of the best written marvel films ever
its a perfect balance of character and action with all the spider characters we all love and even a mini cameo from dead warmongering industrial weapons manufacturer tony stark demonstrating once and for all that even dead iron man is more dangerous to his friends than enemies
oh and peter masters his tingle"
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/et_the_extraterrestrial/reviews?type=user,"['adventure', 'scifi', 'kidsandfamily']",a classic in its own right et has everything a family movie needs and more
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_the_last_jedi/reviews?type=user,"['fantasy', 'adventure', 'scifi', 'action']",it was flashy but i liked less the more i thought about it
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1000626-all_about_eve/reviews?type=user,['drama'],the dialog in these older films is always pretty good eve was really sketchy from the get go here but they didnt give it enough legs as to what she may be up to the films didnt really pick up till the final act and it was all like blam blackmail deceit back stabbing its like 23 of a movie about one thing and then the final 13 they make it about what they said it was all about  if its all about eve they should have made it all about eve
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1018688-shadow_of_a_doubt/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'mysteryandthriller', 'crime']",pretty solid psychological thriller that reminds me of what has macabrely fascinated me since i can remember the more recent real life occurrences where a family member discover their seemingly normal relation is living a double life as a monster no surprise hitchcock recognized and tapped into the horrific implications of this family member being forced to acknowledge the suspicions that because of familial love they are naturally attempting every logistical process to internally dismiss 7510
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1052609-kid/reviews?type=user,"['drama', 'comedy']",with all the charisma and talent of charles chaplin playing his iconic character the tramp and jackie coogans endearing and tender performance the kid is a hilarious classic that has a great and sweet dramatic balance 55  1010
https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paddington_2/reviews?type=user,"['adventure', 'kidsandfamily', 'comedy']",it was very good better than the first at times but noticeably blander in others charming though and a delight to watch 8510 recommended
